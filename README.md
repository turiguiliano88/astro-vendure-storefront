## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

### React components

These are responsible for building UI components and interactivities on the client. As they are just React components, you can probably extract and use them anywhere else (in React project, or Nextjs project ...).
It also follows design-guide carefully in order to create modern looking UI. By quickly modifying color primary / typography / spacing system in tailwind-themes.js you are good to go with your brand.

## SSR functionalites

Every request from browser will be examined on server to see if the customer is logged in or there is any active order by checking the cookie from the request header. The server will therefore redirect to proper route.
This ensure that only proper customer/guest can see his/her private orders/info. It also makes Navbar always up-to-date.
